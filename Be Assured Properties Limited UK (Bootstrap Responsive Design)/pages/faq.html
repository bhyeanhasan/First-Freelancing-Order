            <h6> How does Be Assured Properties make its money if we don’t charge the Landlord fees?</h6>

            <p>We receive our commission from our tenants. Because we work with local companies to rent to their employees and have built up a reputation for delivering an excellent quality of housing with exceptional service we are able to receive a premium.</p>

            <h6>Will I still make the same amount of money as usual?</h6>

            <p>Yes!  Many of our Landlords realise that their net monthly income after traditional agency finders fees, management commissions, void periods and maintenance is significantly lower than our offer and of course it’s not guaranteed in the same way.</p>



            <h6>What happens if Be Assured fail to find tenants? Does this effect our “guaranteed rent”?</h6>

            <p>We have very high occupancy rates so this is rarely an issue, however in the unlikely event we do not find suitable tenants this will never effect the Landlords rent and we will continue to pay.</p>

            <h6>Am I responsible for anything at all?</h6>

            <p>As a landlord, you will need to make sure the exterior/structure of the building is sound and the boiler and electrics are functional. Be Assured Properties is not liable for repairs to these parts of the home (for example, roof tiles and structural soundness). As a responsible landlord, you should make sure the building is insured with the appropriate HMO landlord product, and that you have adequate safety and environmental certificates in place (e.g. Gas safety, Electrical Safety, EPC). Finally, if you have one, it is your responsibility to look after your own mortgage.</p>



            <h6>What is Be Assured responsible for?</h6>

            <p>We are responsible for paying the Landlord the agreed monthly rent, filling the house with our professional tenants and dealing with the management and maintenance of the property. We
            ensure all the utilities and council tax are paid, hire a cleaner and carry out regular inspections to ensure the house is well looked after and take over all of the landlord responsibilities so you can truly be assured.

            Because we only offer the highest quality and standards we generally need to spend money up-front in order to make the house appeal to our market. There will be no cost to you for any decoration or furniture. If any other initial interior upgrades and repairs are required we will come to an arrangement that works for you.</p>
